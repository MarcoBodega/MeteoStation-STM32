This project implements a simple station for monitoring temperature, humidity and gas. It just provide its output using the semihosting functionalities of newlib and Olimex ARM-USB-OCD-H in the Eclipse Environment.

Temperature and Humidity are read in PWM Input mode from the DH11 sensor, while Methan level is read from MQ-2 sensor which provides an analogue outputs.

This branch implements this project on the STM32p107 board from Olimex.
